# React Native i18next Example

This project demonstrates some of the core pieces of localization support that are required when adapting your project to the culture of another country.

In no particular order, those are:

- Translating strings to their native language (Hello vs. Bonjour)
- Formatting dates in their expected format (MDY vs. DMY)
- Formatting currency in their expected format ($1.234,56 vs. $1,234.56)
- and more

## Running the Project

From your terminal, run: `yarn ios` to start an iOS simulator.
